Bridge Battle Crowd Runner - Complete Game Specification Game Overview A hybrid runner game combining mathematical crowd mechanics with continuous shooting combat. Players control a growing/shrinking squad that auto-shoots obstacles while navigating mathematical gates on a Golden Gate Bridge setting.

Core Game Systems:

Squad Mechanics Formation Ultra-tight blob formation - characters packed together touching Hexagonal close-packed arrangement Dynamic reshaping as count changes Center of mass follows player input Natural lag on edges for organic movement Movement Auto-run forward continuously at constant speed Player controls horizontal movement only (swipe/drag) Squad can move across full road width Smooth acceleration/deceleration on direction changes Visual Display Large number bubble above squad Blue circular background (#1976D2) White bold text Scales with squad size (40px for 1-9, 60px for 100+) Pulse animation on change (scale to 1.2x for 0.2s) Mathematical Gate System Gate Types Addition Gates (+) Color: Bright blue (#2196F3) Values: +1, +2, +5, +10, +20 Format: "+X" in white text Adds fixed amount to squad Multiplication Gates (×)

Color: Bright blue (#2196F3) Values: ×2, ×3, ×5, ×10, ×20 Format: "×X" with multiplication symbol Multiplies current squad size Subtraction Gates (-)

Color: Bright red (#F44336) Values: -3, -10, -20, -30 Format: "-X" in white text CRITICAL: If subtraction > squad size = GAME OVER Gate Positioning Single gates: Full road width (mandatory) Double gates: Side-by-side (choose one) Triple gates: Three options (left/center/right) Sequential gates: Multiple rows for combos Gate Appearance Holographic semi-transparent effect Gradient fill (lighter at top) Metal frame structure Height: ~8 units Width: Varies by configuration 3. Continuous Shooting System Auto-Fire Mechanics Squad shoots automatically - no player input Every squad member fires continuously Fire rate: 5 bullets per second per character Bullets travel straight forward with slight spread (±5°) No cooldowns or delays Bullet Properties { speed: 15 units/second, color: "#9C27B0" (purple base), trail: white streak effect, damage: 1 per bullet (base), lifetime: 2 seconds, size: small glowing orb, poolSize: 1000 // for optimization } Upgraded Bullets (with weapon pickup) { damage: 2-3 per bullet, color: "#00BCD4" (cyan), size: larger projectiles, effect: enhanced glow, sound: deeper shooting sound } 4. Obstacle System Tire Stack Obstacles Visual: Stacked black tires (4-6 high) HP Values: 50-300 based on size HP Display: Large white numbers Red background plate Real-time updates as damaged Pulse effect on hit Destruction: Explosion with tire particles Weapon Pickups Position: On top of tire obstacles Visual: Glowing cyan assault rifle Effect: Increases bullet damage Animation: Rotating with glow aura Collection: Automatic when obstacle destroyed Enemy Soldiers HP: 5 per enemy Behavior: Static positions, face player Formation types: Line: Blocking road width Circle: Around obstacles Scattered: Random positions Color: Red uniforms (#D32F2F) Collision: -1 squad member Level Design Environment Setting Golden Gate Bridge Theme

Red support pillars (#C0362C) Cable suspension on sides Gray asphalt road (#8B7355) White dashed center line Ocean water below with wave animation Fog effects in distance Road Configurations Straight sections - Gate choices T-junctions - Force left/right Crossroads - Four-way decisions Curves - Limited visibility Narrow passages - Between obstacles Level Progression Phase 1: Growth (0-100m)

Start with 1 character Focus on multiplication gates Minimal obstacles Target: 30-50 squad size Phase 2: Combat Introduction (100-300m)

Tire obstacles appear (100-200 HP) Weapon pickups available Enemy groups introduced Balance shooting and navigation Phase 3: Complex Decisions (300-500m)

High HP obstacles (200-300) Gates behind obstacles Multiple shooting lanes Strategic route planning required Phase 4: Boss Section (500-600m)

Massive obstacles (300+ HP) Dense enemy formations Critical gate sequences Mastery of all systems needed Visual Specifications Color Palette --road-main: #8B7355 --road-line: #FFFFFF --grass: #7CB342 --tree-dark: #4CAF50 --gate-blue: #2196F3 --gate-red: #F44336 --squad-blue: #03A9F4 --enemy-red: #D32F2F --bullet-purple: #9C27B0 --weapon-cyan: #00BCD4 --tire-black: #212121 --hp-red: #F44336 Camera Settings Angle: 60-degree top-down view Height: 15 units above road Follow: Smooth lag on squad center View distance: Shows ~20 units ahead No rotation: Fixed north-facing Particle Effects tire_explosion: { particles: 20-30, colors: ["#5D4037", "#3E2723"], velocity: random_sphere, lifetime: 1-2 seconds, gravity: true }

bullet_impact: { particles: 3-5, colors: ["#FFEB3B", "#FFC107"], velocity: backward_cone, lifetime: 0.3 seconds }

weapon_pickup: { particles: 30, colors: ["#00BCD4", "#0097A7"], velocity: outward_ring, lifetime: 1 second, glow: true } Performance Optimization Bullet Pooling System class BulletPool { constructor(size = 1000) { this.pool = []; this.active = []; for(let i = 0; i < size; i++) { this.pool.push(new Bullet()); } }

fire(origin, direction) { let bullet = this.pool.pop() || new Bullet(); bullet.reset(origin, direction); this.active.push(bullet); }

update() { this.active = this.active.filter(b => { if(b.lifetime <= 0 || b.hitTarget) { this.pool.push(b); return false; } return true; }); } } Performance Targets 60 FPS with 50 squad members 45 FPS with 100 squad members 30 FPS minimum with 200 members Maximum 500 active bullets LOD system for 50+ characters Game Balance Damage Formulas // DPS Calculation total_dps = squad_size * bullets_per_second * damage_per_bullet

// Clear time obstacle_clear_time = obstacle_hp / total_dps

// Example: 30 squad × 5 bps × 1 damage = 150 DPS // 300 HP obstacle = 2 seconds to destroy Strategic Decisions Shooting vs Avoidance - Clear path or go around? Weapon Priority - Destroy for upgrade or skip? Gate Mathematics - Quick calculations under pressure Squad Size Management - More members = more firepower Risk Assessment - Can I survive -20 to reach ×10? Controls Mobile (Primary) Horizontal swipe/drag - Move squad left/right No shooting controls - Automatic fire Responsive lane switching Visual touch feedback Desktop (Secondary) Mouse drag - Move squad A/D or Arrow keys - Alternative movement No shooting controls - Automatic fire Audio Requirements Sound Effects Continuous shooting - Rapid fire loop Bullet impacts - Metallic hits Obstacle destruction - Explosion + debris Gate pass - Whoosh + chime Weapon pickup - Power-up sound Squad growth - Ascending tone Enemy elimination - Pop sound Audio Mixing Shooting volume scales with squad size 3D positional audio for impacts Music fades during intense combat UI/HUD Elements Essential HUD Squad Counter (bottom center, very large) Score Display (optional, top left) Level Progress (optional, top) Combo Counter (for consecutive hits) Visual Feedback Damage numbers float up from hits Score popups for destroyed obstacles Gate value preview as approaching Screen shake on explosions Critical Implementation Notes Must-Have Features Bridge must be WIDE (40+ units, fills screen) Characters must be BIG (clearly visible) Squad formation must be TIGHT (blob-like) Shooting must be CONTINUOUS (no player input) Gates must be CLEAR (readable at speed) Math must be CORRECT (proper arithmetic) Destruction must be SATISFYING (particles, sound) Common Pitfalls to Avoid Don't make bridge too narrow Don't spread squad too wide Don't require shooting input Don't make gates avoidable if single Don't instant-kill on negative gates Don't make bullets too small/invisible Success Metrics The game succeeds when:

Math decisions feel meaningful - Clear risk/reward Shooting feels powerful - Visible destruction Growth feels earned - Skill-based progression Combat enhances math - Systems synergize Every member matters - More = more firepower Replay value high - Different strategies work Technical Stack Recommendations For HTML5/JavaScript Implementation Engine: Phaser 3 or Three.js Physics: Matter.js or built-in Particle System: Custom or library Audio: Howler.js Touch Controls: Hammer.js Performance: RequestAnimationFrame Optimization: Object pooling, LOD File Structure /src /scenes - MenuScene.js - GameScene.js - VictoryScene.js /systems - SquadManager.js - BulletPool.js - GateSystem.js - ObstacleManager.js /entities - Character.js - Bullet.js - Gate.js - Obstacle.js - Enemy.js /utils - MathHelper.js - ParticleEffects.js - AudioManager.js Development Priorities Phase 1 - Core Mechanics Squad movement and formation Gate system with proper math Basic road generation Phase 2 - Combat System Auto-shooting implementation Bullet pooling optimization Obstacle HP system Phase 3 - Polish Particle effects Sound effects Visual feedback Performance optimization Notes for Developer This is a mathematical shooter where squad size directly affects firepower. The genius is the feedback loop: good math decisions → more firepower → better survival → more math opportunities.

The game should feel like a power fantasy where you're controlling an ever-growing blob of destruction, but with the strategic element of quick mental math under pressure.

Remember: This is NOT a precision game. It's about satisfying destruction combined with rapid mathematical decision-making.
