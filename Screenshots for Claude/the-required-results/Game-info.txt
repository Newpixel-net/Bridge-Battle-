Bridge Battle Game Development Brief
Create a mobile-style runner game called "Bridge Battle" that matches the professional implementation shown in the reference video. This is a satisfying destruction game where players control a squad that continuously shoots obstacles while navigating gates that modify squad size.
CORE GAMEPLAY MECHANICS
1. CONTINUOUS AUTO-SHOOTING SYSTEM

Squad shoots automatically at ~3 bullets per second per character
Each bullet is a glowing projectile with light trails
Bullets should have bullet pooling optimization (single script manages all bullets for performance)
Damage numbers pop up and float away when hitting obstacles (large visible text)
Bullet colors change based on squad size (yellow→green→cyan→magenta)

2. SQUAD FORMATION & MOVEMENT

Squad forms a tight blob formation using separation forces
Characters stay very close but don't overlap
Player controls horizontal movement (can also allow rectangular area movement)
Formation dynamically adjusts as squad size changes
Running animation for all characters

3. GATE SYSTEM (CRITICAL)

Gates span the FULL WIDTH of the bridge - cannot be avoided
Display large visible numbers (+5, -3, etc.)
Correct arithmetic: If you have 5 members and hit -3, you have 2 (not game over)
Game over ONLY when negative value exceeds current squad size
Gates can be shot to increase positive values (important strategy element)
Holographic appearance with gradient colors (blue for positive, red for negative)

4. OBSTACLES & ENEMIES

Tire stacks with large HP displays (100-300 HP)
HP text updates in real-time as damaged
Satisfying destruction with particle explosions
Weapon pickups on top of obstacles (glowing cyan weapons)
Enemy characters that can be destroyed

TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS
VISUAL DESIGN

WIDE BRIDGE: Must fill 80% of screen width
Camera position close (8-10 units back, 8 units up)
Clean, cartoon aesthetic with bright colors
Gray road surface with white lane markings
Red bridge pillars (Golden Gate style)
Beautiful water simulation underneath using sine wave combinations

WATER SHADER IMPLEMENTATION
// Stack multiple sine waves for realistic water
y = Σ amplitude[i] * sin(frequency[i] * (dot(direction[i], position) + time * speed[i]))

Use 4+ wave layers with different parameters
Project wave direction for varied movement
Vertex shader manipulation for performance

OPTIMIZATION REQUIREMENTS

Animation pooling: Precalculate animation frames and instantiate rather than animate
Target 30+ FPS on 2015-era devices
Single bullet manager script (not individual scripts per bullet)
LOD system for distant objects

GAME FEEL ELEMENTS

Screen shake on explosions
Enlargement effects when collecting items
Vibration feedback
Particle effects for all impacts
Floating damage numbers
Smooth camera follow
Sound effects for shooting, explosions, collecting

UI/UX REQUIREMENTS
HUD Elements

Score display (top left, large text)
Level indicator (top right)
Squad counter (bottom center, VERY large, with icon)
All UI elements must be oversized for mobile visibility

Visual Feedback

Damage numbers: Large, golden, float upward
Squad counter pulses when changing
Gates have glowing holographic appearance
Weapons have rotating glow effect
Explosion particles in multiple colors

LEVEL DESIGN

Long levels (1000+ units)
Progressive difficulty
Mix of gates, obstacles, and enemies
Strategic gate placement requiring arithmetic decisions
Weapon pickups placed on obstacles

CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS

Bridge must be WIDE (40 units minimum)
Characters must be BIG and visible (1.5 units tall)
Continuous shooting - no click-to-shoot
Tight squad formation - blob-like, not spread out
Gate arithmetic must be correct (subtraction, not instant death)
Satisfying destruction with particles and numbers
Camera close enough to see action clearly

REFERENCE IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
The original developer used:

Unity engine with vertex shader water
Mixamo for character animations
Optimization through animation pooling
Bullet pooling for performance
Multiple sine waves for water simulation
Holographic gates with gradient shaders
Particle systems for all effects

The game should feel like a power fantasy where holding down creates streams of bullets that destroy everything, with the strategic element being gate navigation to maintain squad size.
